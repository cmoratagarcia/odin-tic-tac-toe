# odin-tic-tac-toe

Practice factory functions by creating a Tic Tac Toe game.

The main goal here is to have as little global code as possible, tucking as much as you can inside factories. 

Focus on getting a working game in the console first. Once you have a working console game, create an object that will handle the display/DOM logic.

Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that shows the results upon game end!
