# odin-tic-tac-toe

Practice factory functions by creating a Tic Tac Toe game.

The main goal here is to have as little global code as possible, tucking as much as you can inside factories. This was the most challenging part of the project, as it required a completely different approach to what I had implemented so far.

Focus on getting a working game in the console first. Once you have a working console game, create an object that will handle the display/DOM logic.

Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that shows the results upon game end!
